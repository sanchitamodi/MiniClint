HACKATHON CHALLENGE
TEAM 6: July 16 - CSU Cal Poly - Math Placement

-
Overview:
- Student admitted
- In dashboard: official info + major requirements + current placement and a placement survey pops up
    - Student can submit data that cal poly doesn’t have / data that they are expecting to receive
- Student then sent an action plan / possible outcomes
- “Then the emails start”
- Lots of common questions (18:30 in meeting)

Objectives:
- Algorithmic method of placing students in courses
- Ai tool can have the conversation with students / possible students
- Public facing math placement chatbot
- Connect chatbot with current status of admission record
    - Could use the chatbot to take in additional data that student has (data student would submit)

Current Workflow:
- Slate (CRM) program for all information gathering (+ student interaction?)
- Lots of student communication through this platform

Pain Points:
- Email threads with 750 students
- Many phone calls
- Common questions - people disregard the FAQ

Problem: 
- Student anxiety
- One person has to respond to emails, phone calls, student inquiries

Ideal solution:
- See objectives section
- On top of slate and FAQ - chatbot for student questions
- Lives in slate portal or some sort of portal
- Part 2: connect to student info

Data:
- Slate does have api access
- Can give anonymized test data
